💰 Insurance Cost Prediction with Regression
This project applies regression analysis to predict individual insurance charges based on features such as age, BMI, number of children, and lifestyle habits using a supervised machine learning model.

📌 Features
Data exploration and visualization using pandas and seaborn.

Data preprocessing: encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

Multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.

📁 Dataset
Typically includes:

age: Age of the insured individual

sex: Gender

bmi: Body mass index

children: Number of children

smoker: Smoking status

region: Residential area

charges: Annual insurance premium (target variable)
